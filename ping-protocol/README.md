## ping-protocol implementation
Working ping-protocol implementation.
## Installation
python 2.7 and a operating system with Berkeley Sockets distribution.
## Files
client.py =====>>> The client side code. 

server.py =====>>> The server side code.
## Usage
In order to run you just need to open two terminals and goto the directory of these files. There run both the files without any command line arguments using python 2.7. 

Just make sure you run the server code before the client side code o/w client side terminal will just show REQUEST TIMED OUT.
